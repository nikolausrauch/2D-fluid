This repository contains proof-of-concept C++ implementations of different *fluid dynamics solvers* in 2D.   
The goal is to provide minimalistic and straightforward implementations, emphasizing ease of understanding.

## Features

- Methods
  - [ ] WCSPH: Weakly Compressible SPH
  - [ ] PCISPH: Predictive-Corrective Incompressible SPH
  - [x] PBF: Position based fluid
  - [ ] FLIP: Fluid Particle in Cell
  - [ ] Stable-Fluid: Eulerian based Fluid
- Utility
  - [x] 2D-Viewer with OpenGL2 and ImGui/ImPlot ([standalone repo](https://github.com/nikolausrauch/2D-viewer))
  - [x] Minimal performance monitoring
  - [x] Hashgrid nearest neighbor search
