This repository contains proof-of-concept C++ implementations of different *fluid dynamics solvers* in 2D.   
The goal is to provide minimalistic and straightforward implementations, emphasizing ease of understanding.

## Features

  - [x] PCISPH: Predictive-Corrective Incompressible SPH
  - [x] PBF: Position Based Fluid
  - [x] IISPH: Implicit Incompressible SPH
  - [ ] DFSPH: Divergence-Free SPH
  - [ ] FLIP: Fluid Particle in Cell
  - [ ] Stable-Fluid: Eulerian based Fluid
- Utility
  - [x] 2D-Viewer with OpenGL2 and ImGui/ImPlot ([standalone repo](https://github.com/nikolausrauch/2D-viewer))
  - [x] Minimal Performance Monitoring
  - [x] Hashgrid Nearest Neighbor Search
  - [ ] Uniform Grid Nearest Neighbor Search
